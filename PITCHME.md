### how the computer sees you

Touchscreens, touchpads and Kinect have changed this perception a little but it remains largely the same.

### Kinect

The Kinect introduced skeletal tracking for full-body interactions but as you can see the image that the computer has of the human is still **reductionist** at best.

electronics let us bridge the gap between the digital domain and the physical world

### Microcontrollers

your washing machine has one

### there are more microcontrollers in the world than there are full computers
They are by far the most ubiquitous form of computing. There are many different kinds but in this course we will be dealing primarily with two kinds AVR and ESP82xx

+++
### AVR chipset
most common for the Arduino family of microcontrollers

+++
### Arduino Nano

+++
### ESP82xx
much more powerful microcontroller, supports WiFi, a lot more memory (4Mb), can be programmed with Arduino toolchain

+++
### Adafruit Featherboard HUZZAH

If you just need a few pins for your project, why use a whole Arduino?
(warning: needs a USB programmer)
